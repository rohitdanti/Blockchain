Project1: Creating an ERC-721 Token Standard Smart Contract on Ethereum

This project involved designing and deploying an ERC-721 Token Standard smart contract, a widely used framework for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract was developed using Solidity and deployed to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet, providing a cost-effective and efficient testing environment.

Key tasks included configuring the development environment, integrating essential ERC-721 methods such as name(), symbol(), and a custom message() function, and verifying contract functionality through rigorous testing. The project showcases proficiency in Ethereum-based smart contract development and provides foundational knowledge for creating EVM-compatible Web3 applications utilizing NFT mechanisms.

This work demonstrates a deep understanding of blockchain technology and practical experience with decentralized development tools like Remix IDE and MetaMask.
