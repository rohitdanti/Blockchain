**Project1: Creating an ERC-721 Token Standard Smart Contract on Ethereum**

This project involved designing and deploying an ERC-721 Token Standard smart contract, a widely used framework for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract was developed using Solidity and deployed to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet, providing a cost-effective and efficient testing environment.

Key tasks included configuring the development environment, integrating essential ERC-721 methods such as name(), symbol(), and a custom message() function, and verifying contract functionality through rigorous testing. The project showcases proficiency in Ethereum-based smart contract development and provides foundational knowledge for creating EVM-compatible Web3 applications utilizing NFT mechanisms.

This work demonstrates a deep understanding of blockchain technology and practical experience with decentralized development tools like Remix IDE and MetaMask.

**Project 2: Hyperledger Fabric Private Blockchain - Supply Chain Smart Contract**

This project involved designing and deploying a private blockchain application for supply chain management on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. Using the Go programming language, I developed a smart contract (chaincode) that tracks and manages products across the supply chain, ensuring secure and immutable record-keeping.

Key functionalities implemented include:

Ledger Initialization: Preloaded example products to set up the supply chain ledger.
Product Creation: Added new products with attributes such as name, status, owner, and category.
Product Updates: Enabled updates to product status, ownership, and other details.
Ownership Transfer: Facilitated secure transfer of product ownership between entities.
Product Querying: Implemented retrieval of product details and full ledger listings.
The smart contract was deployed and tested on a locally configured Hyperledger Fabric network with Docker containers simulating a multi-organization setup. The project provided hands-on experience with blockchain technologies, including ledger interactions, chaincode deployment, and network automation. It also demonstrated how blockchain can be leveraged for real-world applications in supply chain management.
